<h2>About Child Theme Guides</h2>

<p>In order to allow our beloved clients to have their own customizations based on our themes, we declare them compatible with child themes. On top of that, we highly encourage everyone to use a child theme to keep a better track of what is custom made and what is theme based.</p>

<p>Here is our <a href="https://github.com/pixelgrade/guides/tree/master/wp-theme-child">Child Theme Example</a></p>

<h3>An honest promise</h3>

<p>This is a promise from our side that we're keeping our themes aligned to WordPress standards, and we will always give our best to create products that work smoothly with the child theme version.</p>

<h3>The importance of a child theme</h3>

<p>Even if the WordPress documentation about <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes">child themes</a> covers up pretty much everything we want to explain, let's check the big points as follows:</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes#">Assets Management</a> –– Always imagine that a user may want to remove or change assets (like styles or scripts), so try to not make them interdependent.</li>
	<li><a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes#Template_Files">Template Files</a> –– We try to break our templates as much as we can in order to simplify and facilitate the template overwrite process.</li>
	<li><a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes#Using_functions.php">Functions overloading</a> –– Allow PHP functions to be overloaded by the child theme's `functions.php` file.</li>
	<li><a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes#Internationalization">Internationalization</a> –– The user can always have his strings, and he should always be able to translate them.</li>
</ul>
