## About or Guides

This repository is meant to explain, as best as it can, how we work, organize and deliver our products in a public and nice way.

Before you start reading, you should know some *PixelGrade concepts*:

* **Design with attitude** - Our Mantra!

* **Quality first**

* **Transparency** â€“ All we do and how we do it is public, we have nothing to hide.
