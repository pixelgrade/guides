{{ "These are the rules to follow while developing a new WordPress theme.

## The roots of our structure

We follow the [Underscores structure](https://github.com/automattic/_s)(`_s`) since it is a simple and popular framework. It is easy to use and understand for every WordPress community member.

## WordPress Coding Standards

Since we are working with WordPress we respect the environment, concepts and [coding standards](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/best-practices/coding-standards/php).

Aside the rules from Codex we also need to check:

1. Every string must be output in an escaped way with [gettext](http://php.net/gettext) functions like `esc_html__` or `esc_html_e`
* For these gettext functions always use the same string textdomain which is set [here](https://github.com/pixelgrade/guides/blob/master/wp-theme/functions.php#L25) and use only strings (no variables or constants).
* Never add HTML code inside the functions above, if you need to compose an HTML block with strings inside use `sprintf`.
* Also note that strings added to `sprintf` are XSS safe, and they can be output simply with `__` or `_e` functions.

2. Always check what the [Theme Check Plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/theme-check) says.

3. Always localize JavaScript strings or parameters needed (here is an [example](https://github.com/pixelgrade/guides/blob/master/wp-theme/functions.php#L159-L179)).

4. Every PHP function must be prefixed with the Theme Name like this: `guides_get_option`.

5. PHP functions [naming](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/best-practices/coding-standards/php/#naming-conventions) should also be completed by these 2 rules:
   * Use `the_` prefix for functions which should display something like: 'guides_the_title.
   * Use `get_` prefix for function which should return something like: `guides_get_custom_logo_ID`.
   * Uppercase `ID` whenever you can.

## A Child Theme perspective
* Every theme should have a child theme repository as an example following this [structure](http://pixelgrade.github.io/guides/child).
* For child themes to succeed we need to allow them control, so whenever we declare a function we check it with the `function_exists` function, in case it does exists it means it was created by a child theme.
* Try to break down templates into smaller pieces as much as you can in order to be easier for child themes to [overwrite templates](http://pixelgrade.github.io/guides/child#template-overwriting).

## Plugins Integrations

* We use [TGMA](http://tgmpluginactivation.com/) to recommend plugins
* For various integrations with plugins we use the integrations.php file and folder. For example the [woocommerce.php](https://github.com/pixelgrade/guides/blob/master/wp-theme/inc/integrations/woocommerce.php) file
* For Theme Options we use [Customify](https://github.com/pixelgrade/customify)
* For Custom Post Types and Custom Metadata we use [PixTypes](https://github.com/pixelgrade/pixtypes)
* For Shortcodes management we use [PixCodes](https://github.com/pixelgrade/pixcodes)

4. **We strive to keep things licensed under GPLv3. The sky is the limit.**
