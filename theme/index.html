## PixelGrade Theme basis

These are the rules to follow while developing a new WordPress theme.

## The roots of our structure

We follow the [_S structure](https://github.com/automattic/_s) since it is a simple and popular framework. This means easy to use and understand for every WordPress community member.

## WordPress Coding Standards

Since we are working with WordPress we respect the environment, concepts and [coding standards](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/best-practices/coding-standards/php)

Aside from the rules above we also need to check:

1. Every string must be output in an escaped way with functions like `esc_html__` or `esc_html_e`
* For these [gettext](http://php.net/gettext) functions always use the same string textdomain which is set [here](#todo) and use only strings(no variables or constants)
* Never add HTML code inside the functions above, if you need to compose an HTML block with strings inside use `sprintf`.
* Also note that strings added to `sprintf` are XSS safe, and they can be output simply with `__` or `_e` functions.

2. Standards imposed by the [Theme Check Plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/theme-check)
3. Always localize JavaScript strings or parameters needed.

## A Child Theme perspective
* Every theme should have a child theme repo-example following this [structure](http://pixelgrade.github.io/guides/child)
* For child themes to succeed we need to allow them control, so whenever we declare a function we check it with the `function_exists` function, in case it does exists it means it was created by a child theme

## Plugins Integrations

* We use TGM to recommend plugins
* For various integrations with plugins we use the integrations.php file and folder. For example the [woocommerce.php](https://github.com/pixelgrade/guides/blob/master/wp-theme/inc/integrations/woocommerce.php) file
* For Theme Options we use [Customify](https://github.com/pixelgrade/customify)
* For Custom Post Types and Custom Metadata we use [PixTypes](https://github.com/pixelgrade/pixtypes)
* For Shortcodes management we use [PixCodes](https://github.com/pixelgrade/pixcodes)
