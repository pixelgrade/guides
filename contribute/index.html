	Inspired by Chris Beams article <a href="http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/">How to Write a Git Commit Message</a> we want some of these guidelines to be followed while contribute to PixelGrade repositories
</p>

<h3 id="branches">Branches</h3>

<p id="main_branch">As main branch we use the theme name, despite that everybody uses a <strong>master</strong> name we like to keep it clear who is the master in every repo </p>
<p>For plugins instead, since we need to deploy the code on SVN we keep two main branches, one for development named <strong>dev</strong> and one for wordpress.org production version <strong>wporg</strong></p>
<p>If you chose to contribute via a new branch we would like to:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Keep the branch name as short as possible.</strong> I bet no one likes to commit with a command like `git push origin first-rework-wp-job-manager-paid-listings-templates`</li>
	<li id="new_branch"><strong>Start the branch name with the issue id.</strong>Yep, Every new branch should have a related issue opened to explain what should achieve this branch.
		This way if someone else wants to work on the very same thing you can group on the same branch and issue.
		Also when you merge the branch you can automatically close the issue
	</li>
</ul>

<h3>Let's slice the battle zones first</h3>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> If I want to contribute, which is the best way to do it?</p>

<p><strong>The quick way:</strong> In case you need to apply a quick fix or some small patch you can simply patch it directly to the main <a href="#main_branch">branch</a></p>
<p><strong>The proper way</strong> If you want to add a new big feature or a considerable rewrite, you should definitely think about creating a new <a href="#branches">branch</a></p>

<h3>Commit well</h3>

<p>Every time we add a commit we should think that it will be public and loged and other people might want to understand what your commit does. So you need to be explicit about it</p>
<p>The first rule is to split the commit in 3 parts: A subject, A body and Metadata</p>
<h4>The Subject</h4>

<ul>
	<li>It is capitalized</li>
	<li>It is less than 50 chars</li>
	<li>It ends without a dot</li>
	<li>Must start with <a href="http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/#imperative">imperative</a> mood since you command what that patch will do when you apply it</li>
</ul>

<p>Example: </p>
<pre>Remove deprecated methods from functions.php</pre>

<h4>The Body</h4>

<p>The body is the place where you can explain what the commit does</p>

<h4>Commit Metadata</h4>
<p>All the references should capitalized and placed last(like <em>Close #131</em>). It is less important for another teammate to read who it will refer than what it does </p>

<h3>About the Tools</h3>

<p>There are some arguments around the web about how to do a git commit and Chris Beams <a href="http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/#tips">recommends</a> to leave any IDE behind and try to use a primitive
	bash / terminal, this way you can understand better how git works </p>
<strong>At PixelGrade we leave this to the contributor will</strong> but you have been warned about the struggle.
