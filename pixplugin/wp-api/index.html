## Why?

While developing our plugins we encounter the need of using the WordPress REST API more and more often, and we found that the new [V2 API](http://v2.wp-api.org/) can be an enjoyable API to use.

If you ever used the **wp.ajax** JavaScript object or the WordPress **wp_ajax_** PHP filters you should give a serious try to the new REST API since it covers all the flexibility you need.

## From where?

We encourage you to read the full documentation of the [V2 API](http://v2.wp-api.org/) to have the minimal understanding of this system.

The WordPress Codex also has a [handbook](https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/) about the REST API

### The API Client

As a client(aka the entity which gets data from the API), you can always implement your own way of requesting data from API.

There are some recommendations based on the environment you want to use like:

**Javascript**

 * The [wp-api script](https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/using-the-rest-api/backbone-javascript-client/) –– a Backbone collection of all endpoints supported in this API by default
 * There is also a [npm client](http://wp-api.org/node-wpapi/) client
 * The old fashion `jQuery.ajax`(or maybe `fetch` if you feel modern) if you need a simply and very quick way of requesting a specific endpoint and process your response in a specific way

**PHP**

 * The first recommendation is the WordPress function `wp_remote_post`, learn this function well and make your own custom requests.
 * There is a PHP client [exemple](https://github.com/WP-API/client-php) which you can use a starter.
 * Another PHP client [exemple](https://github.com/WP-API/example-client) which has a full integration with the Oauth1

### Custom endpoints

If you want to create your own custom routes, you need to make use of the [rest_api_init](http://v2.wp-api.org/extending/adding/) action. The Handbook has an entire [chapter](https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/extending-the-rest-api/routes-and-endpoints/) about this.

**The response callback**

While creating your own callback, you need to be careful at returning value.

It may be tempting to use the `wp_send_json_` since it is the standard way to end AJAX requests.But remember that this function ends in an `exit` statement so in this case, the API system will not have the chance to run any other actions after that.

A better way to respond in callback is the function [rest_ensure_response](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/rest_ensure_response/)


### Authentication

For Admin dashboard features we recommend the use of the basic [nonce authentication](https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/using-the-rest-api/authentication) since it is simple to use.

For external requests we recommend the [Oauth1](https://oauth1.wp-api.org/index.html) or the [broker authentication](https://apps.wp-api.org/spec/).
