## What is a **Pix** Plugin?

At PixelGrade we have this concept of a PixPlugin, it doesn't define anything straight, or a certain structure, it is simply a concept which tells us to keep our plugins under the same mantra.

The time thought us that we cannot maintain too many plugins under the same core while its complexity grows with every new plugin based on it.

So we decide to switch to a skeleton simple enough to cover all our flexibility needs, but also a popular one to help us be transparent about or plans and features.

The winner is http://wppb.io

So currently we have some plugins on the new core:
- KPIs dashboard.

And a list of plugins based on the old core (which definitely should be refactored)

- Customify
- PixTypes
- PixCodes
- PixProof
- PixFields
